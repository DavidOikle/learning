Hello! This is the parent folder for any learning I've done via Code Academy, the Odin Project, or any other soure.

For more in depth infomation, feel free to dive into any project that might intrest you. 

Since most of these assignemetns will appear both here, and on my persoal website, why have both?

1: As time goes on, and I add more complicated projects to my portfolio, I'll most likely swap out older, less complex work. This is something I did for my demo reel when I was working as a Video Producer. Started with work from my time in college, and eventually cycled in more and more paid work from post college.

2: There will be differences between what I do for Code Academy and the Odin Project. The ones here are more or less going to be what I produce following along the lessons, where as my personal website will have changes that I feel are warranted.
